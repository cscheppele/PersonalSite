            It&apos;s a thrilling tale full of mystery and intrigue leading to the development of one fascinating protagonist.
            {"\n \n"}
            My history is ever changing and will continue to evolve as time does as it is want to do and marches on.
            {"\n \n"}
            The briefest of overviews though.  I grew up in the US.  One of five siblings in a military family.  We moved frequently, once every three years on average.  We eventually settled 
            in Colorado Springs, Colorado and while I was in middle school and then just out of town in high School.  I was always one to take on many projects, 
            engaging in everything: AP courses, horse showing, track, spanish club, musicals.  
            {"\n \n"}
            I attended Oklahoma State University for college.  I initially wanted to be a large animal veterinarian but it turns out you should have
            an interest in biology for that, and while I loved animals and I was great at the biology coursework, I just didn&apos;t enjoy it.  
            That led me to my studies in Psychology and Spanish.  I did my year studying abroad in Teruel, Spain studying Psychology in Spanish as well.  It was in university as well that I found my love for volleyball playing in the 
            school rec leagues.  
            {"\n \n"}
            Upon graduation I decided I didnt want to work in Psychology.  To be a Psychologist requires a masters degree and I had burnt out on studying it, but I had 
            the degree and the Spanish, so I moved to Miami thinking I would get an HR job there and use my spanish.  I ended up continuing to work as a server with a second job
            as an English as a second language while attending a bartender bootcamp.  Miami ended up being much more expensive that I was prepared for and I moved back to 
            Stillwater Oklahoma.  I had paid off mounds of debt working as a server at Eskimo Joes in the past and I figured I would do it again but as a bartender this time.
            {"\n \n"}
            I ended up moving back to Colorado for family matters in 2017 where I began working in bars for the first time and spent the next five years bartending around Colorado, 
            largely in Denver.  The money was nice, but customer service can be quite draining and the more I used games to help me relax, the more I developed an interest in coding.
            {"\n \n"}
            This came to a head during the pandemic and I began looking into what it would take to remaster an my favorite game, Legend of Dragoon.  I started with C# learning vaguely 
            as I had the time, but thinking of it only as a possible hobby. After that first year in the pandemic though I decided this could really be a job
            with more security that customer service, which, as I had just learned, does not have job security.  
            {"\n \n"}
            I moved to Austin Texas with some friends who already worked in the tech industry and who were able to guide me through the starting process learning coding.  What they 
            showed me was invaluable, but I was unfortunate enough to be in serious burnout after years of working 50+ hours a week in customer service.
            {"\n \n"}
            I continued to attempt to learn on my own and was able to get a fair amount done, helping coding friends with their personal projects and 
            beginning some of my own.  I started looking at entry level coding jobs, but everything required experience, so I got back into customer service
            to make some money while I added to my portfolio.  That part-time job ended up being several months of 60 hour weeks however and burnout was building
            again.  Life stepped in though.  I broke my ankle playing volleyball and was not allowed to put weight on it for 4 months, let alone the extra weight
            of carrying liquor boxes so I took it as a sign to bite the bullet and pay for a coding bootcamp (which I had been avoiding for the expense) and figured I might as well go abroad, as I had wanted to move 
            since my time abroad in college.  I found a bootcamp in Spain which checked off all my boxes and I siged up.  I began working on my own projects again in 
            the mean-time while I waited for the program to start and was even brought in by a JAM to help as an actual developer and not just as 
            friend someone was mentoring.  
            {"\n \n"}
            Since the Bootcamp I have continued to establish myself in the world of coding, rejoined volleyball rec leauges now my ankle is healed, and I am looking
            forward to being able to travel, meet new people, design awesome games and raise and show horses again as I continue down this new path before me!
